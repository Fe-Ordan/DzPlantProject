# DzPlantProject

This is v0.1 of the project
We aim to create a small database collection of all the plants in Algeria in a JSON file with some usefull information like medicinal use in both Arabic and French
We will be using some books and catalogues to gather information.


The project will consiste of a input part where the user take photo of the plant then the recognition part where we fetch the information and display it to the user
some of the users are specialist so we will provide a way for the users to add more clear images and contribut other information about the plant.
